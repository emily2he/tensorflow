## chinese-mnist
chinese-mnist is from burness project(https://github.com/burness/tensorflow-101/chinese_hand_write_rec), I notice the accuracy may be able to improve higher, so I add a new conv layer and change a ful conv layer, and also other improve. the accuracy rate is up to 99.2% and also the rete of convergence speed up one time.
